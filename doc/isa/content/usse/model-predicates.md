### Predicates

There are four predicate registers, `p0`-`p3`, per instance **[RE]**. Most instructions take an
execution predicate in `enc[58:56]`, printed before the mnemonic:

| value | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| prints | (always) | `p0` | `p1` | `p2` | `p3` | `!p0` | `!p1` | `Pn` |

The integer multiply-add, colour, dot-product and video groups have only a two-bit predicate
`enc[58:57]`: always, `p0`, `p1`, `!p0`.

- An instruction whose predicate is false does nothing for that instance (**[HW]**, if
  indirectly): our vertex and state programs issue a four-register load into `pa0`-`pa3`,
  predicated on `p0`, right after a test that leaves `p0` false; had it run, it would have
  replaced the vertex the PDS had just DMAed there, and the triangle renders exactly.
- Predicates are written by the **test group** (`p0`-`p3`, chosen by `enc[35:34]`), by
  `rlp` (a seven-bit predicate number) and by `atst8` (`p0`-`p3`, optionally negated)
  **[RE]**. Whether `rlp` and `atst8` reach predicates beyond `p3` is **[open]**.
- `Pn` (value 7) is **[open]**: the reference disassembler prints it for value 7 of the
  full field and nothing in the firmware or the captures uses it. A per-instance or
  per-iteration predicate is a plausible reading, nothing more.
- A repeated instruction tests its predicate once, for the whole instruction **[HW]**
  (*Predicates on repeated instructions*).

**In the firmware [RE].** The microkernel's predicates guard branches above all: 591 of its
954 `ba` are predicated (`p0` 318, `!p0` 94, `p2` 76, `p1` 72, `!p1` 26, `p3` 5). A few dozen
stores, moves, loads and bitwise operations are predicated too. A typical sequence tests a
flag into `p0` without writing a register and branches on it.
